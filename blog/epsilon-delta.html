    <h1>Some Example Epsilon-Delta Proofs</h1>

    <h2>The Epsilon-Delta Definition of a Limit</h2>

    <p>For these examples, given some set \(A \subseteq \RR\) which acts as the 
        domain of a function \(f : A \lra \RR\) we define:
    </p>

    <p>\[ \lim_{x \ra a} f(x) = L\]</p>

    <p>To mean:</p>

    <p>For all \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists some \( \delta > 0 \) such 
        that for every \(x \in A \) if \( 0 < |x - a| < \delta \), 
        then \( | f(x) - L | < \epsilon \).
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Example 0</h2>

    <p>Show that:</p>

    <p>\[ \lim_{x \ra a} f(x) = L \]</p>

    <p>Proof:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>I fix some arbitrary \(\epsilon > 0\)</li>
        <li>I choose \(\delta = \:???\)</li>
        <li>I show that \(\delta > 0\)</li>
        <li>I fix some arbitraty \(x \in A\)</li>
        <li>I assume that \(0 < |x-a|<\delta\)</li>
        <li>I prove that \(|f(x)-L|<\epsilon\)</li>
        <li>I conclude that the proof is complete.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This is the general structure of an epsilon-delta proof. Each step 
        corresponsed to a portion of the definition. If you can't see why each 
        step of the general solution is nessecary, then you will have to review
        the basics of writing proofs, and especially how to use quantifiers.
    </p>

    <p>It's worth mentioning that in the literature, typically Step 3 and 4
        aren't explicitly stated because they are either obvious or not 
        seen as nessecary. However, for a complete argument I believe that 
        they are technically nessecary, and so I will include them in all of
        my own example proofs.

    <h2>Example 1</h2>

    <p>Show that:</p>

    <p>\[ \lim_{x \ra 1} x + 1 = 2 \]</p>

    <p>Proof:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>I fix some arbitrary \(\epsilon > 0\)</li>
        <li>I choose \(\delta = \epsilon\)</li>
        <li>Because of (1) and (2), it's true that 
            \(\delta > 0\)</li>
        <li>I fix some arbitraty \(x \in \RR\)</li>
        <li>I assume that \(0 < |x-1|<\delta\)</li>
        <li>Because of (2) and (5), it's true that
            \(|x-1|<\epsilon\)
        </li>
        <li>Thus \(|(x + 1) - 2| < \epsilon\)</li>
        <li>I conclude that the proof is complete.</li>
    </ol>

    Here, you'll notice I mentioned the lines used to justify certain steps 
    right in the proof. This level of detail is usually not nessecary when 
    writing a math proof. But, because this is meant to help you understand 
    the proofs, I will avoid skipping steps as much as I can.

    <h3>Exercises</h3>

    Prove the following:

    <ol>
        <li>\(\lim_{x \ra 2} x = 2\)</li>
        <li>For all \(b \in \RR\), \(\lim_{x \ra b} x = b\) 
            (How do correctly deal with the extra quantifier?)
        </li>
    </ol>

    <hr>

    <h2>Example 2</h2>

    <p>Show that:</p>

    <p>\[ \lim_{x \ra 0} x^2 = 0 \]</p>

    <p>Proof:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>I fix some arbitrary \(\epsilon > 0\)</li>
        <li>I choose \(\delta = \sqrt{\epsilon}\)</li>
        <li>Because of (1) and (2), it's true that 
            \(\delta > 0\)</li>
        <li>I fix some arbitraty \(x \in \RR\)</li>
        <li>I assume that \(0 < |x-0|<\delta\)</li>
        <li>Because of (2) and (5), it's true that
            \(|x-0| < \sqrt{\epsilon}\)
        </li>
        <li>Thus \( |x| < \sqrt{\epsilon}\)</li>
        <li>Thus \(|x|^2 < \left( \sqrt{\epsilon} \right)^2 \)</li>
        <li>Thus \( |x^2| < \epsilon \)</li>
        <li>Thus \( |x^2 - 0| < \epsilon \)</li>
        <li>I conclude that the proof is complete.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>At this point, I want to talk about how we choose \(\delta\) in step 2 
        of the proof. Typically, we do this by doing the proof in reverse as 
        rough. I will now show how that's done for this proof.
    </p>

    <p>Rough Work:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>\( |x^2 - 0| < \epsilon \)</li>
        <li>\( |x^2| < \epsilon \)</li>
        <li>\( |x|^2 < \epsilon \)</li>
        <li>\( \sqrt{|x|^2} < \sqrt{\epsilon} \)</li>
        <li>\( |x| < \sqrt{\epsilon} \)</li>
        <li>\( |x - 0| < \sqrt{\epsilon} \)</li>
    </ul>

    From now on, I will put the rough work before the proof to show the full 
    work that goes into epsilon-delta proofs.

    <h3>Exercises</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Do the rough work for <b>Example 1</b>.</li>
    </ol>

    <hr>

    <h2>Example 3</h2>

    <p>Show that:</p>

    <p>\[ \lim_{x \ra 3} x^2 - 9 = 0 \]</p>

    <p>Rough Work:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>\( |x^2 - 9| < \epsilon \)</li>
        <li>\( |x + 3| |x - 3| < \epsilon \)</li>
    </ul>
    
    The strategy here is to split the inequality into two as follows:

    <ul>
        <li>\( |x + 3| |x - 3| < C \frac{\epsilon}{C} \)</li>
        <li>\( |x - 3| < \frac{\epsilon}{C} \)</li>
        <li>\( |x + 3| < C \)</li>
    </ul>

    Now we just have to figure out a suitable choice for \(C\). We do this 
    by making sure that \(\delta \leq 1\). This allows us to do the following.

    <ul>
        <li>\( |x-3| < 1 \)</li>
        <li>\( -1< x-3 < 1 \)</li>
        <li>\( 2 < x < 4 \)</li>
        <li>\( 5 < x + 3 < 7 \)</li>
        <li>\( -7 < 5 < x + 3 < 7 \)</li>
        <li>\( |x + 3| < 7 \)</li>
    </ul>
    
    From here it's clear that we should choose \(C = 7\). By reading the 
    proof you can understand why what we did will end up working.

    <p>Proof:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>I fix some arbitrary \(\epsilon > 0\)</li>
        <li>I choose \(\delta = \min\{1, \frac{\epsilon}{7}\}\)</li>
        <li>Because of (1) and (2), it's true that 
            \(\delta > 0\)</li>
        <li>I fix some arbitraty \(x \in \RR\)</li>
        <li>I assume that \(0 < |x-3|<\delta\)</li>
        <li>Because of (2), it's true that
            \(\delta \leq \frac{\epsilon}{7}\)</li>
        </li>
        <li>Because of (5) and (6), it's true that 
            \(|x-3|<\frac{\epsilon}{7}\)
        </li>
        <li>Because of (2), it's true that
            \(\delta \leq 1\)
        </li>
        <li>Because of (5) and (8), it's true that
            \(|x-3| < 1\)
        </li>
        <li>Thus \(-1 < x-3 < 1\)</li>
        <li>Thus \(-1 + 6 < x - 3 + 6 < 1 + 6\)</li>
        <li>Thus \( -7 < 5 < x + 3 < 7\)</li>
        <li>Thus \( |x + 3| < 7\)</li>
        </li>
        <li>Because of (7) and (13), it's true that
            \(|x+3||x-3| < 7\frac{\epsilon}{7}\)
        </li>
        <li>Thus \(|x^2-9| < \epsilon\)</li>
        <li>I conclude that the proof is complete.</li>
    </ol>
