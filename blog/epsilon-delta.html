        <p>In this short article, my goal is to present a fairly simple epsilon-delta proof and then
            break it down in as much detail as possible. My hope is to give readers an insight into 
            exactly what goes into mathematical thinking. By having a deep understanding of each step,
            I hope the reader can construct their own epsilon-delta proofs with confidence that they 
            are correct and make sense.
        </p>

        <p>I have chosen to prove the following. 
            (Assume every variable is a real number unless otherwise specified.)
        </p>

        <div class="box">
            <b>Theorem</b><br>
            <p>Given any functions \(f : \RR \lra \RR\) and \(g : \RR \lra \RR\). 
                If \(\lim_{x \ra a} f(x) = L\) and \(\lim_{x \ra a} g(x) = M\),
                then \(\lim_{x \ra a} f(x) + g(x) = L + M\).</p>
        </div>

        <p>This is a pretty simple result, but because it's a general result about 
            any two functions, it will make for a more interesting and difficult proof.
            To begin, I will present the proof in full.
        </p>
