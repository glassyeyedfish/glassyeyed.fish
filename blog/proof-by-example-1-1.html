    <h1>An Unnessecarily Detailed Math Proof</h1>

    <p>In this series of articles the goal is simple. Teach you how to write
        math proofs using only a series of examples. This is because I think 
        understanding examples and then practicinig exercieses are the best 
        way to learn math (and anything really).
    </p>

    <p>Let's not was time and get into the first example.</p>

    <h2>Example 1</h2>

    <p>Problem:</p>

    <div class="aside">Prove that: For all \(n \in \ZZ\), if \(n\) is even, 
        then \(n^2\) is even.
    </div>

    <p>Solution:</p>

    <div class="aside">
        <ol>
            <li>Fix \(n \in \ZZ\). </li>
            <li>Assume \(n\) is even.</li>
            <li>By definition (2), there exists \(k \in \ZZ\) such that \(n = 2k\).</li>
            <li>By the reflexive property of equality, \(n^2 = n^2\).</li>
            <li>By substitution (3, 4), \(n^2 = (2k)^2\).</li>
            <li>By algebra, \((2k)^2 = 2(2k^2)\).</li>
            <li>By the transitive property of equality (5, 6), \(n^2 = 2(2k^2)\)</li>
            <li>\(2 \in \ZZ\).</li>
            <li>By closure (3, 8), \(2k^2 \in \ZZ\).</li>
            <li>I choose \( l = 2k^2 \). </li>
            <li>By substitution (9, 10), \( l \in \ZZ \). </li>
            <li>By substitution (7, 10), \( n^2 = 2l \).</li>
            <li>By existential introuction (11, 12), there exists \( l \in \ZZ \) such that \( n^2 = 2l \).</li>
            <li>By definition (13), \(n^2\) is even. </li>
            <li>By direct proof (2-14), if \(n\) is even, then \(n^2\) is even.</li>
            <li>By universal generalization (1, 16), for all \(n \in \NN\), if \(n\) is even, then \(n^2\) is even.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <p>First thing to notice. Normally, in textbooks, proofs are not written this way.
        Typically, they are a solid paragraph of text, and they don't have this many 
        details. A more typical version of this proof might look like this.
    </p>

    <div class="aside">Assume \(n\) is even. Thus, \(n = 2k\) for some 
        \(k \in \ZZ\). Since \(n^2 = 4k^2\), it's clear that \(n^2\) is also 
        even as required.
    </div>

    <p>The reason I have chosen to write these proofs as a list which contains
        this much detail, is 
        because I want to make it clear that every proof can be broken down into 
        a series of simple steps. It will easy to check the following:
    </p>
    
    <div class="important">
        Every statement in a proof is either:
        <ol>
            <li><span class="gr">Derived:</span> meaning it follows from zero or more previous statements.</li>
            <li><span class="or">Declared:</span> not derived, but still nessecary to construct a correct proof.</li>
        </ol>
        So, when we have a list of statements, where the last statement is the statement 
        we originally wanted to prove, and each statement was correctly derived or declared, 
        then we know we have a correct proof!
    </div>

    <p>This is SUPER IMPORTANT! It's why is outlined it in red! We will now 
        spend the rest of this article checking each step of this proof in reverse,
        and explaning why each step is important to the complete and correct proof.
    </p>

    <p>We will start from the last line, and work backwards.</p>

    <h3>Line 11</h3>

    <div class="aside">
        <ol>
            <li><span class="bl">Fix \(n \in \ZZ\).</span></li>
            <li>Assume \(n\) is even. </li>
            <li>By definition, this means that there exists \(k \in \ZZ\) such that \(n = 2k\). </li>
            <li>Using some algebra, we see that \( n^2 = (2k)^2 = 2(2k^2) \). </li>
            <li>I'll choose \( l = 2k^2 \). </li>
            <li>Thus, by substitution, \( n^2 = 2l \). </li>
            <li>By closure, we see that \( l \in \ZZ \). </li>
            <li>By existential introuction, we know that there exists \( l \in \ZZ \) such that \( n^2 = 2l \).</li>
            <li>By definition, that means \(n^2\) is even. </li>
            <li>By direct proof we obtain that <span class="bl">if \(n\) is even, then \(n^2\) is even.</span></li>
            <li><span class="pu">By universal generalization</span>, we conclude that <span class="gr">for all \(n \in \NN\), if \(n\) is even, then \(n^2\) is even.</span></li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <p>Here, line 11 is an example of a <span class="gr">derived statement</span>. 
        This means, as we just saw, that it follow from <span class="bl">zero or 
        more previous statements</span>. There is also a <span class="pu">
        justification</span> for why <span class="gr">line 11</span> 
        follows from <span class="bl">line 1 and line 10</span>.
    </p>

    <p>In this case, we are using a rule of inference called "universal 
        generalization". This rule works as follows:
    </p>

    <div class="box">
        To use universal generalization, we need to:
        <ol>
            <li>Fix some variable \(x\) with a certain condition,</li>
            <li>derive some statement \(P(x)\),</li>
            <li>and all other assumptions about \(x\) have been discharged.</li>
        </ol>
        and then we can conclude that:
        <ul>
            <li>For all \(x\) with the condition, \(P(x)\) is true.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>To prove step 11, on line 1 we fix the variable "\(n\)" with the condition that 
        "\(n \in \ZZ\)", on line 10 we derive the statement "if \(n\) is even, then \(n^2\) is even",
        and all other assumptions about "\(n\)" have been discharged, we can 
        conclude that step 11 is a correct step in the proof.
    </p>

    <p>You might have noticed that on line 2, we actually made a futher assumption 
        about \(n\). However, this assumption is discharged on line 10 when we 
        use direct proof. We will discuss this when we discuss line 10.
    </p>

    <h3>Line 10</h3>

    <div class="aside">
        <ol>
            <li>Fix \(n \in \ZZ\). </li>
            <li>Assume <span class="bl">\(n\) is even.</span></li>
            <li>By definition, this means that there exists \(k \in \ZZ\) such that \(n = 2k\). </li>
            <li>Using some algebra, we see that \( n^2 = (2k)^2 = 2(2k^2) \). </li>
            <li>I'll choose \( l = 2k^2 \). </li>
            <li>Thus, by substitution, \( n^2 = 2l \). </li>
            <li>By closure, we see that \( l \in \ZZ \). </li>
            <li>By existential introuction, we know that there exists \( l \in \ZZ \) such that \( n^2 = 2l \).</li>
            <li>By definition, that means <span class="bl">\(n^2\) is even.</span></li>
            <li><span class="pu">By direct proof</span> we obtain that <span class="gr">if \(n\) is even, then \(n^2\) is even</span>.</li>
            <li>By universal generalization, we conclude that for all \(n \in \NN\), if \(n\) is even, then \(n^2\) is even.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <p>Here, to prove line 10, we aren't just using line 2 and line 9. We are 
    actually connsidering the entire arguement from line 2 up to line 9. To 
    see why this is the case, let's quickly see how direct proof works.</p>

    <div class="box">To use direct proof, we need to:
        <ol>
            <li>Start a sub-proof by assuming some statement \(P\)</li>
            <li>Prove some statement \(Q\) inside the sub-proof.</li>
            <li>Dischange the assumption to end the sub-proof.</li>
        </ol>
        and then we can conclude:
        <ul>
            <li>If \(P\), then \(Q\).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Here, starting from line 2 we are assuming that \(n\) is even. Then, 
    after line 9 with dischange that assumption. This allows us to conclude 
    the "if, then" statement on line 10.</p>
