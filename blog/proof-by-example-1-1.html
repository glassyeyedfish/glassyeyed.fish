    <h1>Proofs by Example: Example 1.1</h1>

    <p>In this series of articles the goal is simple. Teach you how to write
        math proofs using only a series of examples. This is because I think 
        understanding examples and then practicinig exercieses are the best 
        way to learn math (and anything really).
    </p>

    <p>Let's not was time and get into the first example.</p>

    <h2>Example 1</h2>

    <p>Problem:</p>

    <div class="aside">Prove that: For all \(n \in \ZZ\), if \(n\) is even, 
        then \(n^2\) is even.
    </div>

    <p>Solution:</p>

    <div class="aside">
        Fix \(n \in \ZZ\). 
        Assume \(n\) is even. 
        By definition, this means that 
        there exists \(k \in \ZZ\) such that \(n = 2k\). 
        Using some algebra, we see that \( n^2 = (2k)^2 = 2(2k^2) \). 
        I'll choose \( l = 2k^2 \). 
        Thus, by substitution, \( n^2 = 2l \). 
        By closure, we see that \( l \in \ZZ \). 
        By existential introuction, we know that there exists \( l \in \ZZ \) such that \( n^2 = 2l \).
        By definition, that means \(n^2\) is even. 
        By direct proof we obtain that if \(n\) is even, then \(n^2\) is even.
        By universal introduction, we conclude that for all \(n \in \NN\), if \(n\) is even, then \(n^2\) is even.
    </div>

    <p>There is a lot to unpack here. For starters, if you didn't already 
        know, this is the definition of an even numbers.
    </p>

    <div class="aside"><b>Definition:</b> For all \(n \in \ZZ\), if \(n\) is even
        iff there exists \(k \in \ZZ\) such that \(n = 2k\).
    </div>

    <p>Go back and read the proof again. Can you find the two places we use the 
        definition of an even number? Just to make it clear, I will now show
        the proof again but with some highlights.
    </p>

    <div class="aside">
        Fix \(n \in \ZZ\). 
        <span class="bl">Assume \(n\) is even.</span> 
        <span class="pu">By definition</span>, this means that 
        <span class="gr">there exists \(k \in \ZZ\) such that \(n = 2k\)</span>. 
        Using some algebra, we see that \( n^2 = (2k)^2 = 2(2k^2) \). 
        I'll choose \( l = 2k^2 \). 
        Thus, by substitution, \( n^2 = 2l \). 
        By closure, we see that \( l \in \ZZ \). 
        By existential introuction, we know that <span class="bl">there exists \( l \in \ZZ \) such that \( n^2 = 2l \).</span>
        <span class="pu">By definition</span>, that means <span class="gr">\(n^2\) is even.</span> 
        By direct proof we obtain that if \(n\) is even, then \(n^2\) is even.
        By universal introduction, we conclude that for all \(n \in \NN\), if \(n\) is even, then \(n^2\) is even.
    </div>

    <p>You'll that I have three colored highlights now. They all mean something specific!</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A <span class="gr">green statement</span> is is a statement we have proven in the middle of our proof.</li>
        <li>A <span class="bl">blue stateemnt</span> is a statement that a <span class="green">green statement</span> follows from.</li>
        <li>A <span class="pu">purple statement</span> is the justification for why a <span class="gr">green statement</span>
        follows from zero or more <span class="bl">blue statements</span>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! In every proof, pretty much every statement FOLLOWS from previous statements, and there 
        is some JUSTIFICATION for why that is true. You should be able to analyze any proof and figure out what statements 
        follow from what other statements and why.
    </p>

    <p>The only exceptions are statements that we have declared to be true. In these articles, I will sometimes highlight them 
        in <span class="or">orange</span>. In our first example proof, here are the statements that have been declared instead 
        of derived.
    </p>

    <div class="aside">
        <span class="or">Fix \(n \in \ZZ\).</span>
        <span class="or">Assume \(n\) is even.</span>
        By definition, this means that 
        there exists \(k \in \ZZ\) such that \(n = 2k\). 
        Using some algebra, we see that \( n^2 = (2k)^2 = 2(2k^2) \). 
        <span class="or">I'll choose \( l = 2k^2 \).</span>
        Thus, by substitution, \( n^2 = 2l \). 
        By closure, we see that \( l \in \ZZ \). 
        By existential introuction, we know that there exists \( l \in \ZZ \) such that \( n^2 = 2l \).
        By definition, that means \(n^2\) is even. 
        By direct proof we obtain that if \(n\) is even, then \(n^2\) is even.
        By universal introduction, we conclude that for all \(n \in \NN\), if \(n\) is even, then \(n^2\) is even.
