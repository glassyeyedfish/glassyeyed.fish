    <h1>How to Write Math Proofs, Part I: Propositional Logic</h1>

    <p>In university level maths, it can be hard to know how proofs are written.
        The goal of this set of blog posts is to teach you how to write 
        correct math proofs, and more than that, how to know when the proofs you 
        write are actually correct.
    </p>

    <p>The first step in this process, is something I will call...</p>

    <h2>Propositional Logic</h2>

    <p>The idea of propositional logic is to look at how different propositions
        (or statements) can be combined to make more complex statements. But 
        first, we have to know exactly what a proposition is.
    </p>

    <p><b>Definition:</b> A proposition is a sentence that we can decide is 
        either true or false.
    </p>

    <p>Some examples of propositions in regular English are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The sky is blue.</li>
        <li>The moon is made of cheese.</li>
        <li>Every number is either even or odd.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some examples of sentences that are not prositions are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>What time is it?</li>
        <li>Go move those boxes to the other room!</li>
        <li>This statement is false.</li>
    </ul>

    The last line in that list of examples may seem like a statement, but the 
    problem arises when you try to decide if it's true or false. I encourage 
    you to try and decide if "this statement is false" is true or false, and 
    you should hopefully then understand why it's not a statement.

    <h2>Combining Statements</h2>

    Consider the statement "My dog is happy and loves to go for walks". You 
    might realize that it can be broken up into two statements.
